Dr. A's Feedback:

Paragraph 1:
- Hook: “Adults think Minecraft does not help kids/teens’ minds.” → Good hook, but avoid using a slash. Consider: “kids and teens.”
- Thesis: “I know Minecraft helps develop the mind.” → Strong idea. Consider strengthening with: “Minecraft is known to develop the minds of children and teens around the world.”
- IQ data: Excellent research, but it belongs in a body paragraph, not the introduction. Save it for later.
- Topic setup: Add a sentence like: “Minecraft helps kids and teens solve real-world problems, boosts creativity, and supports math skills.”

Paragraph 2:
- Too long — needs to be split into multiple sentences.
- Suggested rewrite:
  “Minecraft helps develop problem-solving by requiring players to navigate challenges in an open world. They must creatively use limited resources to overcome obstacles and make goals. They have to think critically to find the most efficient way to progress throughout the game.”

Paragraph 3:
- Excellent content and voice!
- Avoid using “and” to start a sentence.
- Consider adding a wrap-up sentence like: “Creativity and Minecraft simply go together.”

Paragraph 4:
- Grammar needs clean-up. Suggested rewrite:
  “Minecraft can help with math by allowing players to visualize and manipulate geometric concepts. You need area, perimeter, volume, and spatial reasoning to play Minecraft. Through building structures, math is everywhere — you need measurements to keep your build balanced and spacious.”

Conclusion:
- Great energy and heart!
- Reorder to match the introduction (problem-solving, creativity, math).
- Remove the video link unless it directly supports one of your main points.
- Final suggestion: Add a strong final sentence like, “Minecraft isn’t just a game — it’s a mental workout.”

Overall Feedback:
